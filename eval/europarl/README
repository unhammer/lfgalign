There is a sample of 1000 parallel German-English sentences parsed
with LFG at:

http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~ygraham/sample_de.tar.gz
http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~ygraham/sample_en.tar.gz

The sentences are from Europarl[1], where there is a chance of
misaligned sentences due to automatic sentence alignment. Europarl is
available from:

Parses were automatically selected using a disambiguation model in
XLE, so that is also a possible error source.
